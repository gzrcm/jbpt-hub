          <p class="text-lg mt-3">Most fitness programmes fail because they ignore your lifestyle—piling on rules and habits that just don’t stick.

That’s why 70% of people quit their New Year’s fitness goals.

I create programs built around YOU, factoring in what drives or hinders your success, health needs and time commitments. 

The result? A bulletproof plan to help you thrive.

          <p class="text-lg mt-3">Imagine getting fit while still enjoying your favorite chocolate, cakes, or biscuits. 

I design personalized diet plans tailored to your body, schedule, and goals—no fad diets, starvation, or food guilt.

With a focus on moderation, education, and accountability, you’ll build sustainable habits while loving what you eat.

That’s why I create personalized workout plans based on your goals, schedule, and available equipment.
